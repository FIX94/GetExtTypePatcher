# GetExtTypePatcher
This application is designed to pre-patch older Wii titles that do not detect the emulated classic controller of Wii VC.  
To use it, get [GetExtTypePatcher.exe](bin/GetExtTypePatcher.exe?raw=true) and drag and drop your main.dol/00000001.app, it will then be patched if the pattern for it is found.  
The main.dol comes from wii disc isos and the 00000001.app from wii channel wads. After it is patched, repack your title, install it and hopefully have it now working.
